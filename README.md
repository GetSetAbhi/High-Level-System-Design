# High-Level-System-Design
---

I am referencing System Design Interview by Alex Xu Volume I and II for studying about System design.
I felt that it just skims over some of the things without providing any justification. So to cover that part, I've created these notes 
which provide some additional information regarding some design choices which I felt were missing.

I've used chat gpt extensively for making these notes.

**System Design Notes**

1. [Stateful vs Stateless](Stateful_VS_Stateless/)
2. [Design Distributed Rate Limiter](Rate_Limiter/).
3. [Design Notification Service](Notification_Service/).
