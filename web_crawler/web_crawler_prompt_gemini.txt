Conversation Summary: Web Crawler & News Aggregator System Design

This discussion covers the design of a large-scale web crawler, its key components, and how these principles apply to building a news aggregator platform. We have referenced several images providing context (Figure 9-4, Figure 9-8, Content Storage details, and URL Frontier storage details).

1. Web Crawler Workflow (High-Level - Figure 9-4)
The core workflow involves:

Seed URLs (starting points)
URL Frontier (manages URLs to be crawled)
HTML Downloader (fetches web pages)
Content Parser (parses HTML, extracts text)
Content Seen? (deduplicates content)
Content Storage (stores unique content)
Link Extractor (finds new URLs from crawled pages)
URL Filter (filters new URLs)
URL Seen? (deduplicates URLs)
URL Storage (persistent store for all URLs)
Feedback Loop (new/updated URLs go back to URL Frontier)
2. Key URL Prioritization Strategies
The URL Frontier uses strategies to decide which URLs to crawl next:

PageRank/Authority-based: Prioritize based on perceived importance/links. (e.g., nytimes.com > myblog.com)
Freshness/Update Frequency-based: Prioritize frequently changing content. (e.g., reuters.com/news > olduniversity.edu)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)/Depth-based: Prioritize URLs closer to seed URLs. (e.g., example.com/about > example.com/archive/2005/...)
URL Pattern/Type-based: Prioritize specific content types or paths. (e.g., articles/ > images/) These are often combined.
3. URL Frontier Detailed Working (Figure 9-8)
The URL Frontier manages URLs using a hybrid approach (disk for scale, memory for active operations) to ensure politeness and prioritization.

Components:
Input URLs: New URLs from Link Extractor or re-crawls.
Prioritizer: Assigns a priority score to URLs based on strategies.
Front Queues (f1, f2,..., fn): In-memory/distributed queues (e.g., Kafka topics) storing URLs by priority. f1 for highest, etc.
Front Queue Selector: Picks URLs from Front Queues, typically prioritizing higher-priority queues.
Back Queue Router: Receives URLs, determines the target Back Queue based on hostname.
Mapping Table: A high-performance Key-Value Store (Redis). Stores hostname -> (back_queue_id, last_access_timestamp). Used by Back Queue Router for routing and by Back Queue Selector for politeness check. Not a full database of all URLs itself, but a fast lookup table for active politeness data.
Back Queues (b1, b2,..., bn): In-memory/distributed queues (e.g., Kafka topics/partitions), with each queue generally dedicated to URLs from a single host. URLs wait here to enforce Crawl-delay.
Back Queue Selector: Monitors Back Queues, releases URLs to Worker Threads only when Crawl-delay for that host has elapsed.
Worker Threads (HTML Downloader): Fetch content.
Why Kafka for Queues? Provides scalability, durability (persists to disk), high throughput, and decoupling between components.
Why separate Disk Storage for URL Frontier?
Massive Scale: Stores billions of URLs with their full state (crawled, pending, error) for long-term durability, beyond Kafka's typical retention.
Complex Querying/Re-crawl Scheduling: Enables queries like "all high-PageRank news URLs not crawled in 24 hrs," which Kafka isn't optimized for.
Deduplication (URL Seen?): Acts as the comprehensive record for checking if a URL was ever seen.
Technology Choice for URL Storage: Cassandra is an excellent choice due to its massive scalability, high write throughput, and high availability, acting as the persistent backend for the entire URL set.
4. Content Seen? and Content Storage

Content Seen?: A component that deduplicates content. After parsing, it checks if the content (via hash/fingerprint) already exists in Content Storage. If so, it's discarded to save storage and processing.
Content Storage: Stores the unique, crawled web page content.
Purpose (from provided image): Stores HTML content. Choice depends on data type, size, access frequency. Uses a hybrid approach: most content on disk (too large for memory), popular content in memory (for low latency).
Technologies:
For Bulk Raw HTML (Disk): Distributed File System (DFS) or Object Storage (e.g., HDFS or Amazon S3).
HDFS: Good for on-premise, co-located compute (Hadoop ecosystem), full control, predictable costs.
S3: Good for cloud-native, managed service, elastic scalability, pay-as-you-go, high durability.
For Metadata/Indexed Content/Popular Content (Memory/Fast Disk): NoSQL Document Database or Search Index (e.g., Elasticsearch or MongoDB).
Elasticsearch: Ideal for full-text search, complex queries, aggregations, and fast reads for serving.
Cassandra (as an option for Metadata): Good for high write throughput, massive scale, and availability for core metadata (like URL, crawl status, pointers to S3). Not a document store, but a wide-column store.
MongoDB (as an option for Metadata instead of Cassandra): Good for schema flexibility (document store), rich query language, and developer friendliness. Suitable when schema agility and more complex metadata queries are important.
Combined S3 + Cassandra/Elasticsearch: This combination is powerful. S3 stores raw HTML. Cassandra stores core metadata and pointers. Elasticsearch indexes searchable content and serves queries. This provides efficient indexing, querying, and retrieval, which object storage alone cannot.
5. News Aggregator Platform Design
Leverages the crawler concepts with specific adaptations:

Functional Requirements:
Aggregated feed from thousands of sources: Supported by scaled URL Frontier, Content Parsing, and a Search Index (Elasticsearch).
Infinite scroll: Supported by Search Index optimized for pagination.
Redirect to publisher's website: Requires storing the original URL as metadata in the Search Index/Metadata store.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Availability prioritized over Consistency (AP system):
Justifies choices like Kafka (distributed queues), Redis (Mapping Table), Cassandra (URL Storage/Metadata), and Elasticsearch (Search Index), all of which are designed for high availability and partition tolerance, often favoring eventual consistency over strict immediate consistency. This ensures users see "slightly outdated content rather than no content at all."
Storing Parsed HTML:
Not strictly required for direct user-facing feed/redirection (as users go to publisher's site).
Highly beneficial for internal purposes: Re-processing, re-indexing, content deduplication (hashing), quality control, debugging, long-term archiving, and providing the full text for search indexing.
